    <h2>Game 2048 AI designing based on supervised learning and CNN</h2>
<div class="g2048-text">
		<p>Facilitating game board initialization, player move data storing and training, prediction based on trained AI by constructing respective objects.
Construct CNN with 5 convolutional layers and 3 dense layers. Running 300000 games with super AI, and sample 1000 moves from each game for supervised training.
Evaluate trained model performance according to 50 games average score, and build website app that display model playing on graph interface.</p>
